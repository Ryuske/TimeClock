====== README ======
TimeClock was developed as an open-source time management system that can interface with nearly anything.

The original idea was that it would be used with an RFID scanner for punching in & out, however, through
the development it was abstracted using it's RESTFUL API and can be used by anything that can make a web
call.

TimeClock was developed by Kenyon Haliwell and can be download at https://github.com/Ryuske

====== API ======
The API is very simple, but for our example we are going to assume the TimeClock was install at
http://example.com/timeclock

+++ API for punching in & out +++
    http://example.com/timeclock/payperiod/tx/<uid>
        Where <uid> can be anything you want, but the auto generator will generate a 4-bye hex ID.
        
        The will response in this format: Kenyon, in, 11/18/13, 8:00am

    --- Example UID ---
        0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
        Please note that the UID for every employee MUST be different, but it can be anything you want.

+++ Rest of the API +++
    http://example.com/timeclock/payperiod/rx/<uid>/employee_name
        This returns the full name of the employee with a format of <firstname> <lastname>
    
    http://example.com/timeclock/payperiod/tx/<uid>/last_op
        This returns "in" or "out" (without quotes) depending on if the employee punched in or out last.
        
    http://example.com/timeclock/payperiod/tx/<uid>/last_time
        This will return the last time the employee punched in or out. Format: 5:00pm, 12:00am, etc
        
    http://example.com/timeclock/payperiod/tx/<uid>/total_hours/<pay period>
        This will return the total hours an employee worked for the given pay period. If no pay period
        is given it will return the current pay period. The response is in hours (i.e. 17.25 hours)
        
        Pay Period: This can be given in almost any format, however a date within that pay period works best
            Example: 11/18/13 - would return the pay period 11/18/13-11/24/13
        
====== Explaination of Backend ======
Once you login, the first page you're presented with is the full list of employees. The add a new employee all you
do is look over to the right, and click the "Add New Employee" button near the top and full out the basic information.

+++ Adding New Employee +++
    When you add an employee, if you specify a username you have to enter a password. Once you've given them a username
    and password they will be able to login to the backend and perform any of the operations. If you don't want them to
    have access to the manegement panel, don't enter a username.

    Also note, that even if the generate UID checkbox is checked, if there is something written in that box, it will take
    precedence. So if you want it to generate a UID, make sure the text box is empty.

+++ Editing An Employee +++
    Once you've added an employee or two, you can click on the pencil to the right of their name and edit their profile.
    The employee editing form looks exactly the same as adding a new employee, and it also works the same way.

+++ Removing An Employee +++
    You can remove an employee by click on the trash can to the right of their name. You'll be presented with a confirmation box
    with their name with confirm and cancel buttons.
    
+++ Viewing Pay Period +++
    You can view an employees times by click on their name on the home page. The first pay period you will see is the current one.
    Under the current pay period is a list of all the previous pay periods that the system is aware of. Any pay period that is bold
    is one that as a time entered for that employee. The italic pay period is the one you are currently looking at.
    
    The total hours for the pay period are displayed by the employees name in the blue bar.
    
    You can remove a date from a pay period if you "zero" out all the times for that date (or row, more specifically). Just enter blank
    times for all of them and the date will be removed.
    
    --- Edit a Time ---
        You can edit any time that the employee has worked by clicking on the time you wish you edit. You'll be presented with a box
        that you can enter the time into. All total hours will auto populate. You can also edit the next in/out fields that are blank.
    
    --- Add a Date ---
        If you click the Add Date button that is below the pay period table, you can add a date worked to the table. You can also add
        duplicate dates in-case the employee punched in and out more than 3 times. When you click Add Date you'll be given a calendar
        where the only dates you can click are the ones within the pay period that you are looking at.
        
    --- Printing a Timecard ---
        You can view a printer friendly version of the pay period by clicking on the Print button to the right of the employees name in
        the blue bar. It just gives a very basic table with the employees name, pay period you're looking at, total hours and hours worked.
        
+++ Punching In and Out +++
    Please refer to the API on how to punch an employee in and out.

====== Installation ======
To install TimeClock, you will have to download https://github.com/Ryuske/PHP-Framework which is a framework that was also developed by
Kenyon Haliwell. Refer to the installation instructions of the framework for what goes where. However, the directory struture of TimeClock
is the same as the framework. So it's just copy & paste.

Once you have all the files installed. you're going to have to import timeclock.sql into a database and update the file in /configuration/
to use your MySQL information. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the frameworks README. It will explain how the
configuration files work.

After you have imported the database, you'll have to manually add a user to the employees table. The password will have to be a MD5 hash.

*** Please note that simplifying the installation is on the TODO list ***
